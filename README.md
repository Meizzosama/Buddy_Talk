This is new Flutter Project with a backend source of Firebase..

I have made this open source project because, i didn't completed this in my past year, so i thought 
maybe it can be used as an open source like anyone re-build this application
by their own. So, ive integrated the firebase id as well if you also want to 
get the access of it than contact on my email: meizzosama@gmail.com

ps: the ui is not so good, but ive used getx state management when i was practicing it 
in my free time.

so, that's it and use it.

Thank you!
